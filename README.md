# EC200 GSM/GPRS Module

The EC200 is a compact, cost-effective GSM/GPRS module designed for mobile communication and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including voice, SMS, and data transmission, all controlled through AT commands via UART communication.

This module supports:

GSM/GPRS Connectivity: Enables communication over mobile networks, perfect for applications requiring remote control or data transmission without the need for a Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection.

SMS Functionality: Can send and receive SMS messages, making it suitable for applications like remote monitoring, alarm systems, and other messaging-based IoT projects.

Voice Calls (optional): Some variants of the EC200 may support voice calling functionality (dependent on the module version and carrier support).

Low Power Consumption: Designed to work with low power, making it an ideal choice for battery-operated IoT devices.

Key Features:

UART Interface: The EC200 module communicates with microcontrollers, like the STM32F103, via UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter), making it easy to interface with most MCU platforms.

AT Command Set: EC200 uses a standard AT command set, allowing users to send SMS, make calls, and even query network information with simple ASCII commands sent over UART.

Multi-band Support: The module typically supports multiple GSM bands, ensuring global compatibility with mobile networks.

Compact Design: Small form factor, ideal for embedding in space-constrained devices.

In this project, the STM32F103 microcontroller interfaces with the EC200 module via UART to send SMS messages using basic AT commands, making it a simple yet effective solution for remote communication in IoT projects.
